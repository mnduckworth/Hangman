# Hangman

Hangman is a JavaSctipt based application that has an array of different where one is selected at random.
Once a word has been selected the letters are replaced with the underscore sybmol and displayed on the screen.
If the user correctly guesses a letter to the word the blank is then replaced by the letter accordingly, or if the user
incorrectly guesses a letter it is added to the incorrect guesses portion of the screen.
The user is given 13 incorrect guesses. If they run out it is counted as a loss, and if they get the word it is a win.
